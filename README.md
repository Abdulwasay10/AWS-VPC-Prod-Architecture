AWS Project: VPC with Public & Private Subnets (Production Setup)

This project demonstrates how to set up a production-style VPC with both public and private subnets on AWS. The goal is to launch application servers in private subnets, expose them through a load balancer, and connect via a bastion host.

Architecture Overview

We‚Äôll build this architecture step by step:

Create a VPC with public & private subnets.

Launch instances in Auto Scaling Groups (private subnets).

Configure a Bastion/Jump Host for secure access.

Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

Access the deployed application via the ALB.

Step 1: Create VPC

Go to VPC and click Create VPC.

Select VPC and more option ‚Äì AWS will suggest subnets, route tables, internet gateway, etc. Preview the settings.

Name the VPC and set the IP range (I used 10.0.0.16/16, ~65,536 IPs).

Keep default settings:

Availability Zones: 2

Public Subnets: 2

Private Subnets: 2

NAT Gateways: 1 per AZ

VPC Endpoints: None (for now)

Click Create VPC and watch AWS set everything up.

Step 2: Launch Instances in Auto Scaling Groups (Private Subnets)

Open EC2 ‚Üí Auto Scaling Groups ‚Üí Create Launch Template.

Configure the template:

Name & description

AMI: Ubuntu (example)

Instance type: t2.micro (Free Tier eligible)

Key pair (to SSH into server)

Security Group: allow Port 22 (SSH), Port 8000 (app)

[Important] Select the same VPC created earlier

Create the Launch Template.

Now create an Auto Scaling Group using that template:

Select the VPC

Choose Availability Zones ‚Üí private subnets

No Load Balancer (for now)

Desired/Min/Max capacity ‚Üí set according to expected load

Skip scaling policies (default)

Wait until the Auto Scaling Group launches instances.
Verify EC2 instances ‚Üí they should be in private subnets.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: These instances won‚Äôt have public IPs, so you cannot SSH directly. That‚Äôs where the Bastion Host comes in.

Step 3: Bastion/Jump Host

Go to EC2 ‚Üí Launch Instance.

Configure:

Ubuntu image, t2.micro

Provide key pair

Security group: allow SSH (Port 22)

VPC: same VPC as application instances

Enable Auto-assign Public IP

Launch the instance.

SSH into the Bastion Host.

Now, to SSH into private EC2 instances:

Copy your private key into the Bastion Host using scp:

scp /path/to/local/key.pem user@<bastion-public-ip>:/home/ubuntu/


From the Bastion Host, SSH into private instances using their private IPs.

‚úÖ Once inside, you can host a simple web application on Port 8000.

Step 4: Create Load Balancer

Go to EC2 ‚Üí Load Balancers ‚Üí Create Load Balancer.

Choose Application Load Balancer.

Configure:

Name: choose something meaningful

Scheme: Internet-facing

IP type: IPv4

VPC: your project‚Äôs VPC

Availability Zones: select both public subnets

Security Group: allow Port 8000

Configure Listeners & Target Groups:

Listener: HTTP, Port 8000

Create a Target Group:

Type: Instances

Protocol: HTTP, Port 8000

Select VPC & register private EC2 instances

Go back to the ALB config:

Add another Listener: HTTP, Port 80 (to expose the ALB publicly)

Forward traffic to the Target Group created above

‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt forget: allow Port 80 in the ALB security group else it will be not reachable

Step 5: Access the Application

Copy the DNS name/URL from the Load Balancer.

Open it in the browser ‚Üí you should see your app running on Port 8000, exposed via Port 80 on the ALB.

üéâ Congratulations! You just deployed a production-style VPC project with private subnets, bastion host, and an application load balancer.

Bonus Tip

To test load balancing:

Change the app text (e.g., "MY FIRST AWS" ‚Üí "MY SECOND AWS") on different servers.

Refresh or put load on the site ‚Üí watch the load balancer distribute traffic.
